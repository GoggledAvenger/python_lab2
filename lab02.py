#Part 2: Statements and Modules

#Part 3: Expressions and Operators
sumplus5 = age + 5
htminus4 = height - 4
agexht = age * height
htdiv2 = height / 2
agediv3 = age // 3
agesqrd = age**2

print(f'''
The sum of my age and 5 is {sumplus5}.
The difference between my height and 4 is {htminus4}.
The product of my age and my height is {agexht}.
The quotient of my height and 2 is {htdiv2}.
The remainder of my age divided by 3 is {agediv3}.
My age squared is {agesqrd}.
